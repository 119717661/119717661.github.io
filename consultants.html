		<h2><b>Hyperautomation</b></h2>
			<p>When automation moved to the forefront of most industries, many businesses felt reluctant to implement this new technology. 
			Rather than focusing on the immensely broad and undeniable benefits of utilising automation for business process improvement, business leaders feared change and employees
			worried about losing their jobs.
			However, with the progression in automation technology, trends like hyper-automation are growing, meaning that businesses are now shifting their practices towards creating 
			“people-centric smart workplaces.” 
			This change has ushered in a new era for business operations that rely on technology and automation tools to maintain a competitive edge.
			This is especially true in the Financial services sector.
			As the year comes to a close, Gartner announced its tech trends for 2020, with hyper-automation at the forefront. 
			Find out everything you need to know about hyper-automation so you can understand the precise reasons why it matters for your organisation’s continued success.</p>
			<p><b>What is Hyper-automation? </b></p>
			As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI)
			and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated,
			but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” 
			In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. 
			<p><b>How is Hyper-automation Different from Regular Automation?</b></p>
			When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically 
			advanced tools and combines them to create a new way to work. 
			It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can
			be produced automatically and run efficiently with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, 
			agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making. </p>

		<h2><b>Multiexpirience</b></h2>
			<p><b>Future of App Development is Multi-experience:</b></p>
			<p>Now, before you start thinking about Multi-experience Development. I want you to list out the brands that you feel more connected to.
			Most probably you might have thought about the Biggies in the industry – Apple, Amazon, Samsung, Nintendo, Nike, and Sony. Now recollect the ways you interact with these brands. 
			It might be through physical devices television, phones, tablets, and smartwatches. These physical devices serve a lot of digital experience flavors like – video, audio, or web-based.
			User experiences that we have through these devices add to the perception of the brand.  
			And an edgy positive perception; makes a good brand reputation.
			In a competitive market, brands make continuous modernization its priority. Because, if you are not trending, nobody is going to hold on to you. Even a single bad experience can cost tons to your name.
			This is why enterprises that want to strengthen their digital experience are now looking for solutions 
			to streamline their user’s experience across multiple platforms. Despite web browsers continuing
			to be the most popular touchpoint, an immersive range of devices that serves multi-experience like smartwatches,
			smartphones, and voice-driven devices permeate the industry. Claiming that the modes of interaction are expanding across the digital user journey.</p>
 			<p><b>What is Multi-experience Development?</b></p>
			<p>Multi-experience development platforms (MXDPs) help enterprises to rapidly scale their applications across a range of devices and platforms.
			MXDPs can help you develop a single application that can be deployed on a variety of devices.
			This greatly shortens down your efforts and gives brands more control over their digital experiences.</p>
			<p><b>Multi-experience-Development</b></p>
			<p>MXDPs will be the new Mobile App Development Platforms (MADPs) 
			Buyers in the market are looking to address the challenge of building and delivering a sizable portfolio of mobile apps for customers, partners, and employees.
			They now are looking for complete user experience. It is no longer enough for them to simply interact with a mobile app or web application. 
			MADPs have enabled development for mobile, web, and desktop web. 
			Even hitting the minimum, brands are now including one more additional experience, which includes – chats, AR, and wearable.
			Consumers’ desire for more have caused the evolution MXDPs that supports Multiple Experience</p>
			<p><b>Some of the top leveragers of MXDP</b> </p>
			<p>MXDP companies worldwide
			MXDP simply means the Low Code platform integrating customized environmental experiences. The technology has gained massive traction because it comes with massive digital transformation.
			Here are some more top reasons why enterprises are moving towards MXDPs –
			Top-Rreasons-enterprises-moving-MXDPs-SignitySolutions</p>
			<p>1. Offer internal operational efficiencies
			MXDPs help enterprises to support a large number of internal operations in a single space. 
			With every process being present in one system, processes can be easily streamlined. 
			MXDP enables organizations to create efficient, faster, and valuable digital experiences.</p>
			<p>2. Reduce Time to Market for Mobile Apps
			MXDPs can significantly improve development time by as much as 10 times. 
			All because of the reusable code and streamlined design processes. And with faster releases, 
			feedback cycles can also be shortened. This helps in creating and honing your digital experiences.</p>
			<p>3. Better Control over Actual Deployment
			It takes a week to conduct a single cloud-based deployment. But with the right MXDP, 
			information can be directly sent to your cloud-based server provider, such as Amazon Web Services. 
			Plus, MXDPs are also going to provide a full-distributed environment on your behalf. Providing more efficiency by streamlining the deployment process.  </p>
			<p>4. Eliminate potential security Risk
			With your application feeding on a single platform like MXDPs, you can get a 360 view of your software landscape. 
			This can eliminate all the potential security risks like shadow IT that many organizations struggle with.</p>

<!-- Distributed Cloud Container   --->
	<div id="Distributed Cloud" class="container city animate-opacity">
		<h2><b>Distributed Cloud</b></h2>
			<p>Industry experts believe that together, edge computing and distributed cloud improve the user experience of a network.
			While these technologies are related, they are distinct and unique.</p>
			<p>Edge computing refers to computing happening at the edge of a network. 
			Various access points define the network edge, hence the name for its architectural standard,
			Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). Edge access points include cell phone towers, routers, WiFi, and local data centers.</p>
			<p>A distributed cloud refers to having computation, storage, and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud.
			Examples of a distributed cloud include both fog computing and edge computing. 
			Establishing a distributed cloud situates computing closer to the end user, providing decreased latency and opportunities for increased security.
			Potential security solutions include a blockchain-based security architecture or random auditing of data to check for integrity. 
			A distributed cloud also processes data in real-time.</p>
			<p>As network attacks increase, security is more important than ever. Learn about the most pressing security issues today with the Big Security Guide.</p>
			<p><b>The Future Need for Edge and Distributed Cloud</b></p>
			<p>Edge computing is already a reality. It’s anticipated that a significant increase in connected technology 
			will surge the demand for edge computing to alleviate network traffic. One major contributor to its growth is the Internet of Things (IoT).
			Santhosh Rao, Gartner’s senior analyst, commented that “currently, around 10 percent of enterprise-generated data
			is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud. By 2025, Gartner predicts this figure will reach 75 percent.”</p>
			<p><b>The Advantages of Edge Computing as a Distributed Cloud</b></p>
			<p>Maintaining Connectivity</p>
			<p>Edge computing offloads data to the cloud during peaks in computing traffic, thus ensuring a quick, reliable, real-time connection.
			For example, IoT devices often require constant internet connections, sometimes along with low latency needs.
			Edge helps manage the massive amounts of data produced by IoT devices by storing and processing the data locally until a connection can be reestablished,
			or by quickly sending data to the central cloud when the network is overwhelmed.</p>
			<p><b>Smart Manufacturing</b></p>
			<p>Edge computing allows smart manufacturing machines to operate without relying on a large central data center or cloud. 
			Using the edge for analysis of data gathered on location minimizes the amount of data infrastructure needed and means less frequent disruptions.
			With edge computing, machines in a smart factory will be automated. Edge computing can enable the many devices in the factory to work together.
			Sensor data can allow for changes to speed of operations to adapt to conditions of the machinery. 
			Outside of IoT uses, predictive analytics can help factory managers plan for machine part replacement, minimizing downtime.</p>
			<p><b>Decreased Congestion</b></p>
			<p>Since distributed clouds are local to the user, data only has to travel a short distance to the compute, storage, or network resources.
			This means less data is going greater distances to large data centers or centralized clouds, and there is an overall decrease in network traffic congestion.
			A distributed cloud can reduce the strain of wearable devices on the core network, 
			ecause data from those devices doesn’t have to go as far to get to the necessary server for data storage and processing, minimizing the use of network infrastructure.</p>
